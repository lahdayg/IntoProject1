TIMINGS
Don't spend any more than two hours on this - if you do you've gone too far!  More likely, it will take an hour or 
less. If it is taking longer, consider providing notes about what you would have done if you had more time.

TASKS
1) Write the automation test to switch the localisation - make a note of your process in the Notes.txt file.

2) Refactor the code base how you see fit - do _not_ edit the DriverArrange() or GetProjectPath() methods in the DriverArrange.cs 
   Make a note of your refactorings in the Notes.txt file as you go. 

OUTPUTS
1) A solution that builds, and where all automation tests pass.
2) A note about your process for implementing the missing automation test.
3) A note about the reason for each refactoring (in the Notes.txt file).
4) Any observations or suggestions for further improvements (if you were to spend more time on this).
